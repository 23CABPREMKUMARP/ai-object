# How to Install Tamil Voice on Mac

Your application requires a system-level Tamil voice to speak in Tamil. Since your Mac doesn't have one installed by default, the app is falling back to English.

Follow these steps to install the "Vani" (Tamil) voice:

1.  **Open System Settings** on your Mac (Apple Menu -> System Settings).
2.  Go to **Accessibility** in the sidebar.
3.  Click on **Spoken Content**.
4.  Click on the drop-down menu next to **System Voice**.
5.  Select **Manage Voices...**.
6.  In the search bar, type **"Tamil"**.
7.  You will see **"Vani"** (India). Click on the cloud download icon ☁️ next to it to install.
    *   *Note: You may also see "Lani" or others, but "Vani" is the standard Indian Tamil voice.*
8.  Wait for the download to complete (it may take a minute).
9.  **Restart your browser** (Chrome/Safari) completely for it to detect the new voice.
10. Open the app again, and the Tamil voice should work!

## Troubleshooting
If it still doesn't work after restarting:
1.  Refresh the page.
2.  Try opening the app in **Google Chrome** if you are using Safari, or vice versa. Chrome sometimes has its own "Google Tamil" voice built-in.
